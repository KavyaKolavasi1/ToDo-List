## Overview
### Description
This project involves the use of a To-Do List, which is used to track important tasks to be done throughout the day. It involves the use of HTML. CSS, and Javascript to implement a text box for the user to record tasks. The app also allows for strikeout and deletion of completed tasks in a visually appealing display.

### Implementation
* **index.html:** The index.html file includes the general structure for the app text-box as well as task input section.
* **style.css:**  The style.css indicates the various color,size, font, background, and other visually appealing changes provided for the to-do list.
* **script.js:** The javascript portion of the project allows for ability to store tasks, strikeout completed tasks, and remove tasks to create a new list.
